### 2. Why were ECMA standards created


- European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) is a private international non profit standards organisation. 

- Netscape took JS to ECMA in November 1996 for standardization of the language. 
JavaScript standards were not called javascript standards because of the keyword Java in it. Sun microsystem( now acquired by Oracle ) didn’t allow the use of keyword “java” hence standards were called ECMAScript. 

- JavaScript was a Scripting language first implemented by Netscape for its browser Navigator3. 
With rise in popularity of Scripting language, like Javascript, many vendors implemented their own standards to make javascript compiling engines, which made it very tough for developers to stick to different versions of Javascript engines being implemented. This problem was solved for developers when all the vendor decided to stick to one standard. 

- ECMAScript were the standards made so that browser vendors could implement them while creating respective Javascript engines ( v8, rhino, etc ). Due to popularity of JavaScript the main ECMAScript are misunderstood to be only the standards for JS, however there are other languages like ActionScript.
