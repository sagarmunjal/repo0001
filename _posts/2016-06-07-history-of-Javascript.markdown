### Creation of Javascript
JavaScript (different from Java) took a mere 10 days to create in May 1995 by this guy

- He was tasked with creating a language like Java by Netscape -his then employer

- However, he found Java complicated so he decided to create a language that even beginners could code, and thus JavaScript was born. Now that was not what it was always called.  It was first named Mocha. Then LiveWire.

Then  LiveScript. And finally Javascript. The current name was adopted post receiving the trademark license from Sun Microsystems in the December of 1995.

- The very reason JavaScript was commissioned was for its use in the second version of Netscape’s browser that was due to be launched. Initially Navigator 2 was the only browser to support a scripting language.

- But things changed in a year or two. Microsoft’s IE(Internet Explorer) made their own version of JavaScript borrowing largely from it and conveniently calling it JScript. It was a reverse-engineered implementation of  JavaScript that was launched in July 1996.

- Before Microsoft launched Jscript in IE, Navigator 2 was quite popular browser but after Microsoft implemented Jscript in IE, Navigator 2 popularity declined because of Microsoft's monopoly. 

- And since IE was the most popular browser at that time, Netscape was forced to shut down its project. 

- At that time, when the scripting language was gaining traction, it was too risky to leave the future of the scripting languages in hands of any particular company/ competitor. Hence Netscape decided to hand over the control to International Standards Body called ECMA. 

- Netscape decided to be standardised by ECMA International leading to ECMAscript. ECMAscript is a standard which ensures that when a code is written, it should follow the rules of the standard and only then would it run in a browser that implements the standard. 

- Think of it this way - there were many browsers back then such as IE, Navigator2.
