#### **2.1 Value types** 

> - Number

All numbers like 0,3.4 and also pseudo-numerical values like NaN and Infinite.

> - Strings

“Meow”

> - Boolean

True and false values.
                
> - Null, undefined

Special values

> - Objects 

Other values like functions, arrays are objects

_To be honest, the types are complicated to explain because really there are Functions, Arrays, Date, RegExp which also fit somewhere in the tree above. But for now lets just keep it as simple as it’s shown above._
